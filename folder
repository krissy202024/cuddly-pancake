In the "Name your file…" field, type the name of the file you want to create. You can specify subdirectories by adding them to the file name (e.g., folder/subfolder/newfile.md).
Add content:
Below the filename input, there’s a large text box where you can enter the content of the file. This is where you can write or paste the contents of your file.
Commit changes:
Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section.
You’ll need to provide a commit message. GitHub suggests a default message (e.g., "Create [filename]"), but you can customize it.
You can also add an optional description if desired.
Choose whether to commit directly to the main branch or create a new branch for the changes (this is helpful if you're collaborating and want to make a pull request).
Click "Commit new file":
Once you're ready, click the green Commit new file button.
